rough draft ideas

Open and read in file of the animals and put their rank into a dictionary. The file is ordered from slowest growth to fastest.
dict[]: { [1:Horse], [2:Buffalo] ….[14:Squirrel] }
write function readFileintoDict() and return the dictionary 

Create an array where you write out each equation in python form in the order of your scrambled documents
arr(): [ n^2, log n, 5^n, 8n, 4log n^2, 2^log n… ]

Sort these equations by their end behavior or how it grows towards infinity. Insert a large number(ex:1000) to check larger/smaller 
have a functions called compare() to check 2 equation for larger which returns boolean value
Then modify the given sorts to check using compare() for larger value
